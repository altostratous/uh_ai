# uh_ai [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/altostratous/uh_ai.svg?token=ez8zbxzdziakcqLTQox4&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/altostratous/uh_ai)
CSP and DPLL example project essentially done as a course project. And also our funny artificial intelligence project done by uncaulked hypocrites.

# Description
We decided to implement it using pure python.

# Test
You can view [.travis.yml](https://github.com/altostratous/uh_ai/blob/master/.travis.yml) to see how to run the tests. You can look at the tests to see how the command line user interface works.

# Documentation and the Project Definition
## Code Documentation
We tried to implement it expressively. 

## Problem Documentation
The project definition is available [here](https://github.com/altostratous/uh_ai/blob/master/doc/AI_Project.pdf) in Persian. We will add an english translation if someone requests.

As an overview the problem defined in this project is to put some colored blocks on a rectangle and satisfy the constraints as well. The constrains are as follows:
*  blocks don't overlap,
*  blocks don't have a common side unless they differ in color.
